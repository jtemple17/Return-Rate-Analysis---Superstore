# Return Rate Analysis - Superstore
Key Findings
- There is a small correlation between sales and returns. As a whole, the more sales a sub-category has, the less returns that sub-category experienced. This is calculated by: units returned/units purchased.

- Return Rate by City shows return hotspots within states. Southern California, Texas, and Washington show this finding to be true.

- Technology is the most returned category with 27%.

- August is the month with the highest return rate, followed by September. These are both end of summer months -- something to consider.

- Consumer segmented customers produced the most returns at 28%.
